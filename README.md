# Meal Planning App

The Meal Planning app is designed to assist users in creating and managing their personalized diets. With this app, users can effortlessly create multiple diets and assign specific days of the week to each one. They have the flexibility to add multiple meals within each diet and populate them with various foods.

The app allows users to add different types of foods to each meal, specifying the amount of protein, carbs, and fats along with the quantity for precise tracking. Additionally, users can select their target weight and the type of diet they wish to follow. Based on these inputs, the app calculates and displays the total calories consumed on the dashboard, as well as the target calorie intake tailored to the selected diet and desired weight.
